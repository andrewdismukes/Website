      <description>The first step in a reproducible research workflow starts with Version Control. If you are unfamiliar with Version Control Systems, I’ll provide a brief overview of git. If you are already familiar with git, skip this. There are other programs that accomplish similar ends, but I’m most familiar with git and github, so I’m going to limit my discussion to those tools.
Git was originally created to track development of the Linux kernel.</description>

      <description>This is the first post in a short series I am going to do on workflow and reproducible research. I’m going to detail the process I use on a pretty granular level, because some of the tools (version control and git, Markdown, knitting in R, etc.) may not be familiar, and because I did a lot of troubleshooting along the way. But first, it’s important to explain my motivation to learn the tools that make up this workflow.</description>
