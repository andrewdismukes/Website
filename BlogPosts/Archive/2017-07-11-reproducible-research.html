<p>This is the first post in a short series I am going to do on workflow and reproducible research. I’m going to detail the process I use on a pretty granular level, because some of the tools (version control and git, Markdown, knitting in R, etc.) may not be familiar, and because I did a lot of troubleshooting along the way. </p>
<p>But first, it’s important to explain my motivation to learn the tools that make up this workflow. And that means defining the fundamental problem this workflow addresses. </p>
<p>Reproducible research began as an attempt to fight the phenomenon known in computer programming as bit-rot. In this context bit-rot refers to the decay of performance of a particular object due to changes in the environment in which it resides. The parallel of this in academics is the invasive cluttering that occurs, both physically and mentally, as a project gains momentum and accumulates versions and drafts across code and text. Note that this use of bit-rot explicitly includes mental decay as a core problem. Signicant issues with research come about because scientists can’t remember what they did in the past. This is a real and universal phenomenon. Perhaps you didn’t take good enough notes at the time to reproduce your analyses. Perhaps you can’t remember what version of a code or document you left off with and edit the wrong one. Perhaps your computer crashed or the external hard drive you back up to was corrupted. All of these reasons, and many, many more, cause simple projects to become cluttered over time. Reproducible research is the attempt to define a system - a workflow - that combats the bit-rot phenomenon by using tools that were designed with this problem in mind. </p>
<p>The goal of reproducible research is, at every step, to produce a document that has all the information necessary to complete any and every stage of creation process from that point backward, and can be used in multiple ways going forward. The most common use would be an academic paper or report such as a journal article, thesis or dissertation or analysis summary. A document of this type would contain all the text that has been drafted as well as all the code that generates the output. This document must also have an associated version history that accurately tracks all changes over time that led to its creation. Furthermore, this document should be able to move forward along various trajectories - as a pdf, word document, html webpage, or formatted journal submission - with ease. In subsequent posts I’ll detail how to make this happen. </p>
