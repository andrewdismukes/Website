      <description>It wasn’t that hard to do. I’ll have a full tutorial coming, and perhaps a more developed and polished interface, but the bulk of the project is embedded below. It’s written using Shiny in R. I’ve wanted to get more into interactive visualization for some time and just haven’t had the time or energy to try to learn. In academia you don’t really have a call (at present) to develop these interactive visualization skills for work - journal articles don’t require interactives.</description>
