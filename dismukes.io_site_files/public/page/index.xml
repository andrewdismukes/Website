      <description>I live in State College, PA with my wife (Brooke), son (Murphy), two dogs (Charley and Harper), and cat (Apollo). Before State College, my wife and I spent two years in Ames, Iowa and six years in New Orleans. I completed my master’s degree in biological psychology in New Orleans, and my wife finished her pediatric residency there. I completed my Ph.D. at Iowa State in Ames. We have been living and working in State College since the summer of 2018.</description>

      <description>THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE CORTISOL RESPONSE TO DYADIC STRESSORS IN BLACK AND WHITE INFANTS  These findings suggest that race-related differences in hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal reactivity are present in infancy, and that the first year of life is a crucial time period during which interventions and prevention efforts for maternal–infant dyads are most likely able to shape hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal reactivity thereby mitigating health disparities early across the life course.
