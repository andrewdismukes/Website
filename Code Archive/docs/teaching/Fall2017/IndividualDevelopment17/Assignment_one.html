<h2 id="goals"><i class="icon-info-circled"></i>Goals</h2>

<p>Your first assignment is a reflection. The <strong>goal</strong> of this assignment is to develop and systematize your current perspective on human development. The <strong>purpose</strong> for this assignment is to establish a baseline for how you think about the developing human, based on your own ideas, experiences, perspectives, and circumstances, and what we have discussed so far. We will revisit this essay in your third assignment, which will detail ways in which this baseline perspective has or has not changed over the course of the class. Assignment one and assignment three are paired assignments. </p>

<p>I would like you to answer a series of questions about human development.  The questions are as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><i class="icon-tasks"></i> <strong>Questions:</strong></p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>Human development can be considered from multiple perspectives. One question is to ask how a single human being changes over time - in effect, how a person changes and grows over their lifespan. Another question is to ask how multiple people at the same time point in their life are alike or different. In human development terms, this is referred to as within-individual change vs. between-individual differences. Which of these interests you the most and why? </li>
  <li>Is age a good way of measuring human development? Why or why not? </li>
  <li>Is development continuous or discontinuous? By which I mean, do people change at the same rate over their life course, or does development happen faster or slower based on where you are in your developmental trajectory? </li>
  <li>What is your ‘<strong>philosophy of human development</strong>?’ <br>
  <ul><li>I want you to summarize, going in to the class, how you think about human development. I cannot tell you how to do this: only that I really want you to stop and think about what matters in the developing human being. The above questions are helpful in shaping your philosophy. Focus on universal ideas - try to go beyond thinking about just what has shaped you, but what common (or uncommon) experiences may impact most everyone - this is not meant to be a personal reflection as much as it is meant to be a statement of your current perspective on what contributes to within-individual change and between-individual differences. </li></ul></li>
  </ul>

<h2 id="format"><i class="icon-info-circled"></i>Format</h2>

<p>This document should be 3.5 - 4 double spaced pages. Use the APA format specified <a href="https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/560/01/">here</a>.  Include a title page and references section if references are present, but this <strong>does not count toward the page count</strong>. Make sure to format in-text and and reference section citations appropriately. If this is your first time writing in the APA style, this is a great opportunity to learn how to follow a style guide accurately. Title each question with the question number and nothing else, do not re-type the question.  I really want 3.5 to 4 pages of <strong>CONTENT</strong>. Do not use formatting or spacing tricks. I expect half a page to a page per question, with more emphasis on question 4 - your philosophy of human development. Each of the above questions should have a unique section. Save a copy of this essay for yourself, you will need it for assignment 3. </p>

<p>I care about what you write, but I also care about <strong>how</strong> you write. The ability to clearly and concisely relate your ideas is invaluable. There are a host of good writing guides for students, such as <a href="http://svmiller.com/blog/2015/06/dos-and-donts-of-writing-for-students/">this</a>, <a href="https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/683/01/">this</a>, and <a href="http://www.uq.edu.au/student-services/learning/general-writing-tips">this</a>. Let me add a few of my own, personal tips for writing in this class:</p>

<ul>
<li>Use proper punctuation and grammar. </li>
<li>Use the right word, not a big word. Language is meant to convey an idea, not make you sound smart. Choose the words that best convey your idea, simply and clearly. </li>
<li>Writing should be efficient.  Do not use two words where one will do. </li>
<li>Do not use <a href="https://literarydevices.net/hyperbole/">hyperbole</a> or <a href="http://www.tamug.edu/writing/no%20show/Avoidchichesandcoloquialisms.html">colloquialisms</a>. Write formally and professionally.</li>
<li>EDIT!!! No one writes a perfect first draft. Everyone has to edit to achieve good content. </li>
<li>Focus on organization in the beginning, but do not use multiple headings to take up space. </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="submission"><i class="icon-info-circled"></i>Submission</h2>

<p>Submit a word document through the assignments tab in blackboard. If you do not have word, there are many available open-source editors such as <a href="https://www.libreoffice.org/">libreoffice</a> that can save as word format, or <a href="https://www.google.com/docs/about/">google docs</a> can also do this. Blackboard cannot display non-word format, so if you submit a document in an alternative format I will not be able to read it and you will get a zero for the assignment. This assignment is due on Friday, 9/22/2017, by 11 pm CST. </p>
