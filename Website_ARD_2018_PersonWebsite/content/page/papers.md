## THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE CORTISOL RESPONSE TO DYADIC STRESSORS IN BLACK AND WHITE INFANTS

>  These findings suggest that race-related differences in hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal reactivity are present in infancy, and that the first year of life is a crucial time period during which interventions and prevention efforts for maternal–infant dyads are most likely able to shape hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal reactivity thereby mitigating health disparities early across the life course.

## ASSOCIATION BETWEEN NEIGHBORHOOD VIOLENCE AND BIOLOGICAL STRESS IN CHILDREN

> Neighborhoods are important targets for interventions to reduce the effect of exposure to violence in the lives of children. These findings provide the first evidence that objective exposures to neighborhood-level violence influence both physiological and cellular markers of stress, even in children.

## DIURNAL AND STRESS-REACTIVE DEHYDROEPIANDROSTERONE LEVELS AND TELOMERE LENGTH IN YOUTH

>This study is one of the first studies to examine basal, diurnal and reactivity measurements of DHEA in youth. Furthermore, this is the first study, to our knowledge, to demonstrate a positive association between DHEA, a putative anti-aging hormone, and TL, an indicator of cellular aging.

## CONTEXT INFLUENCES THE INTERPLAY OF ENDOCRINE AXES ACROSS THE DAY

> Findings suggest that the notion of “stress” must disentangle proximal and distal challenges, each of which appears to impact neurobiological processes.

## COUPLING OF THE HPA AND HPG AXES IN THE CONTEXT OF EARLY LIFE ADVERSITY IN INCARCERATED MALE ADOLESCENTS

> When youth had higher testosterone levels, they had higher cortisol and DHEA levels, indicating positive “coupling” of the HPA-HPG axes. In addition, children experiencing greater life adversity had tighter coupling of the HPA-HPG axes. Additional analyses hint that coupling may be driven largely by HPG axis functioning. Results indicate that positive coupling of the HPA-HPG axis is observed within incarcerated adolescents, especially for those with the greatest life stress.

## BEYOND PHYSIOLOGICAL HYPOAROUSAL: THE ROLE OF LIFE STRESS AND CALLOUS-UNEMOTIONAL TRAITS IN INCARCERATED ADOLESCENT MALES

> These results extend neurobiological theories of cortisol and illustrate that boys with the combination of severe stress with CU traits have a unique physiological profile.

## PSYCHOPATHY'S INFLUENCE ON THE COUPLING BETWEEN HYPOTHALAMIC-PITUITARY-ADRENAL AND -GONADAL AXES AMONG INCARCERATED ADOLESCENTS

> The current study is novel in its emphasis on testing the coupling of HPA and HPG hormones among incarcerated adolescent males. Results suggest that affective and interpersonal psychopathic traits are marked by unique HPA- and HPG coupling.

## RIDING THE PHYSIOLOGICAL ROLLER COASTER: ADAPTIVE SIGNIFICANCE OF CORTISOL STRESS REACTIVITY TO SOCIAL CONTEXTS

> While the costs and benefits of cortisol are emphasized for normal stress regulation, this dynamic context-dependent purpose of stress hormones should extend to the development of psychopathology as well.

## BIOMARKERS, SCIENCE, AND THE PREDICTION OF VIOLENCE: CLINICAL AND LEGAL ISSUES

> The real utility of biomarkers is in their ability to inform about which aspects of the
environment are most capable of altering the individual “under the skin”. Courts are
advised to consider biomarkers as changing measures that reflect the individual’s
context or risk.
