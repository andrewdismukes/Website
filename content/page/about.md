I live in State College, PA with my wife (Brooke), son (Murphy), two dogs (Charley and Harper), and cat (Apollo). Before State College, my wife and I spent two years in Ames, Iowa and six years in New Orleans. I completed my masterâ€™s degree in biological psychology in New Orleans, and my wife finished her pediatric residency there. I completed my Ph.D. at Iowa State in Ames. We have been living and working in State College since the summer of 2018. 

When we aren't working, we enjoy hiking and traveling as a family. 

# Research Focus

**WHO?**
I focus on the early part of the lifespan, from prenatal to early adolescent time frames, with the developing child as the focal point of my research. However, the ecological and social context of the child is of paramount importance in development. To that end, I view my research as heavily inclusive of the environmental context each child experiences, and this means primary caregivers, the broader family and peer ecosystem, and even neighborhood and city level constructs are vital points of inquiry.

**WHAT?**
I am most interested in the conversation that occurs between environmental experience (particularly early life adversities) and physiological parameters. I view the what of my research as an interactive, multi-modal process that is broken up into component parts for the sake of modeling and conceptualization but realistically operates as a cohesive, interconnected, and multivariate whole. This vantage point extends from environmental experiences to biological underpinnings to behavioral manifestations.

*Early Life Adversities:* The environmental context in which a child finds him or herself is a core component of my prior research training and a catalyst for research future directions. Disentangling the chronicity and severity of abuse and/or neglect and the impact these experiences have on physiological or behavioral parameters across development is a primary goal of my research.
*The HPA Axis:* One of the primary outcomes I look at is the Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal Axis, a biological cascade initiated in the brain that culminates in the release of cortisol, the so-called 'stress hormone'. My research concentrates on three questions surrounding the HPA axis: (1) how do changes in one axis impact associated systems (for example, the Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Gonadal Axis), (2) what are the mechanisms that drive that change, and (3) how do those changes influence development and inform health and disease later in life.
*Genetic and Epigenetic Regulation Across Development:* The genome and genetic regulation informs my view of the developing human. The mechanisms by which the building blocks of human development are coded for and regulated is integral for a robust understanding of the way the environment impacts biomarkers, and the way biomarkers impact behavior. To that end, I pursue a mechanistic understanding of biological systems that begins with the genome and focuses on gene expression.
*Behavior:* Thus far may research has focused on the presence of Callous Unemotional Traits as a behavioral cluster of importance, given that this trait is a particularly intractable and costly cluster of behaviors for the individual and society. In the future I hope to expand this to include a broader range of mental health domains.

**WHEN?**  
I focus on the early part of the lifespan because of the incredible change that happens within individuals from the prenatal window through adolescence. There are opportunities inherent in that window of time to alter the course of a lifespan and mitigate the impact of early life adversities, from biology to behavior.

**WHERE?**  
Because my research often requires samples with significant hardship, I focus on collaboration as a research necessity. I have worked with internationally adopted children, incarcerated children, and children from disadvantaged neighborhoods, as well as normative infant and adolescent samples. The collaborations that have served as the backbone of this research have spanned institutions across the United States and internationally.

**WHY?**  
I view the developing human as a contextually adaptive organism. Biology is not destiny, it is a process that changes over the course of development. My core research focus thus far has been to examine the way that environment and biology interplay across different time scales. I also view biological process as intrinsically linked, such that systems work in concert, not isolation. My approach usually includes assessment of multiple biomarkers, across levels of analysis, fluctuating with either environmental context or in the prediction of behavioral outcomes. I employ this approach as a means to characterize as accurately as possibly the multivariate nature of biological processes, and to focus on the largely unexplored relationships between biomarkers, across levels of analysis, above and beyond single systems operating independently, in order to characterize and hopefully improve the lives of children that have experienced hardships.
